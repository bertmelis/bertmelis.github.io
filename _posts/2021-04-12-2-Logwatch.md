Unless something is wrong, you don't actively browse through your server logs. But how do you know something's wrong? Logwatch serves you handy summaries of your logs.

<!--more-->

I strongly advise you to [set up msmtp](/posts/1-MSMTP) or any other mail transfer agent on your server. Without it, Logwatch will not send you the handy report.

## Installation

[Logwatch](https://sourceforge.net/projects/logwatch/) is available in the standard Debian repositories.

```
$ sudo apt install --no-install-recommends logwatch
```

On my system, this installs `libgdbm-compat4 libgdbm6 libperl5.28 logwatch perl perl-modules-5.28`.

## Configuration

First copy the default config template to the configuration directory.

```
$ sudo cp /usr/share/logwatch/default.conf/logwatch.conf /etc/logwatch/conf/
```

Next, edit the file.

```
sudo nano /etc/logwatch/conf/logwatch.conf

# find and change these lines:
Output = mail
Format = html

# set to one of the recepient as in /etc/aliases or use an e-mailaddress
MailTo = root
```

## Finishing up

You can test Logwatch by issuing the following command:

```
sudo /usr/sbin/logwatch
```

If this error pops up

```
/var/cache/logwatch No such file or directory at /usr/sbin/logwatch line 643.
```

then create the cache directory yourself.

```
sudo mkdir /var/cache/logwatch
```

Test again
