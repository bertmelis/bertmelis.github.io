I don't want my server to be an smtp-server but I do want it to be able to send me e-mails. Hence, [Postfix](http://www.postfix.org/) is overkill and I settled with [msmtp](https://marlam.de/msmtp/) and Gmail.

## Installation

Installation is straightforward. msmtp is available in the Debian's repositories.

```
$ sudo apt update && sudo apt install msmtp msmtp-mta
```

On my system this installs `ca-certificates libgsasl7 libntlm0 msmtp openssl`.

## Preparation

msmtp is not a full blown smtp relay. We want it to send e-mail through the Gmail-smtp-servers. While you can go the long way and go for OAUTH2 and explained in [the Arch Linux wiki](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/msmtp#OAUTH2_Authentication_for_Gmail), I went for the short version with app passwords. you can read more about this on the [Google help pages](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/185833?hl=nl).

First make sure you [enabled 2-factor authentication](https://myaccount.google.com/signinoptions/two-step-verification/enroll-welcome) for your Gmail-account.


Next, generate app password: [https://security.google.com/settings/security/apppasswords](https://security.google.com/settings/security/apppasswords).
It looks like this: `fgoelxqlduacnryt`. Write it down or temporarily save it to a file because you'll only see this once. You'll have to create a new password then.

Possibly, unblock with the captcha: [https://accounts.google.com/DisplayUnlockCaptcha](https://accounts.google.com/DisplayUnlockCaptcha)

## Configuration

In my case I only set up one account, the default. I don't need individual users to be able to send their own e-mails.

The configuration resides in one file:

```
sudo nano /etc/msmtprc

# Copy the contents below
account        default
auth           on
tls            on
tls_trust_file /etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt
logfile        /var/log/msmtp

# gmail
host           smtp.gmail.com
port           587
from           youraccount@gmail.com
user           youraccount
password       yourapppassword

# Syslog logging with facility LOG_MAIL instead of the default LOG_USER
syslog LOG_MAIL

# Aliases file
aliases /etc/aliases
```

In the `aliases` file the system looks for the address where to send the e-mails to. Hence, we populate the file.

```
$ sudo nano /etc/aliases

# Copy the contents below
# Bug: recursive lookup doesn't seem to work in current Debian version
# Setting every e-mailaddress explicitely
mailer-daemon: postmaster
postmaster: root
nobody: root
hostmaster: root
...
root: youraccount@gmail.com
```

## Test and finalize!

Send an email:

```
$ echo "Hello this is sending email using msmtp" | msmtp bertmelis@gmail.com
```

There might be a problem with the setup. Somehow msmtp doesn't create its logfile.

```
$ sudo touch /var/log/msmtp
$ sudo chown msmtp:msmtp /var/log/msmtp
$ sudo chmod g+w /var/log/msmtp
```

Now it works:

```
echo "hello there username." | msmtp -a default username@domain.com
```

One more thig. The app password is stored in plain text. So we should limit access to this file.

```
# limit access
sudo chmod 660 /etc/msmtprc
# create a group called 'msmtp' not needed, probably already there
# sudo groupadd msmtp
# repeat the following for each group member
sudo usermod -aG msmtp username
```

We're all done!
