Hi, cześć, hallo! I'm Bert Melis and I'm a reliability engineering consultant by trade and IoT enthusiast by heart. I'm graduated as Master in Industrial Sciences and further expanded my skills with courses like Six Sigma/Green Belt, shutdown management, predictive maintenance and reliability engineering. I worked for both small companies and multinational corporations, in a variety of industries.

### Home automation

The first steps into the world of IoT was by reading out my water meter and electricity meter at home. Later I made an Arduino library to interact with Viessmann heating systems. With this library you can control your heating system using any device you want without relying on cloud services. Meanwhile my work is also used by others. The happiness when it works and the appreciation of the users make me continue to improve and deliver.

*Thank You for reading!*
