## VitoWiFi

Arduino Library for ESP8266 to communicate with Viessmann boilers using a (DIY) serial optolink.

Based on the fantastic work on openv. Check out this wiki for a simple hardware implementations

You can find my library here: [https://github.com/bertmelis/VitoWiFi](https://github.com/bertmelis/VitoWiFi).

## eModbus

Joint project to bring a compliant modbus server and client to ESP32 for RTU and TCP.

Read the docs at [https://emodbus.github.io](https://emodbus.github.io).

## esp32WS2811

My library is an Arduino library for ESP32 to drive WS2811 LEDs using the RMT peripheral on ESP32 microcontrollers.

It is a wrapper library around the WS2811 driver written by @nkolban, published on [his Github account](https://github.com/nkolban/esp32-snippets).

You can find my library here: [https://github.com/bertmelis/esp32WS2811](https://github.com/bertmelis/esp32WS2811).

A full blown demo application is available here: [https://github.com/bertmelis/ledController](https://github.com/bertmelis/ledController).

## async-mqtt-client

async-mqtt-client is a Arduino MQTT library for ESP8266 and ESP32. Altough not my project, I did try to improve the library significantly.

you can find the code here: [https://github.com/marvinroger/async-mqtt-client](https://github.com/marvinroger/async-mqtt-client).
